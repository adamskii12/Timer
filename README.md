Welcome to my timer! Be sure to download both the CSS style sheet and the JavaScript script along with the HTML file.

For simplicity's sake:
  - the maximum time possible is 100 minutes and 59 seconds
  - the minimum time possible is 1 second

The implementation of the JavaScript script was done using a mixture of OOP and functional programming. The structure of the code has an emphasis on readability and cleanliness. For the parts of code that may not be clearly understood, I've added descriptive comments along with 'EFFECTS:' clauses that describe the usability of functions.

Enjoy!
